- Hi, I am @raoghenerume.
- I am a quantitative researcher in measurement and evaluation with a penchant for the intersection between AI analytics, data science, psychometrics, and quantitative psychology.
- Currently, I am interested in the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for programme evaluation and educational assessment.
- Therefore, I am seeking collaborations on assessment-based AI/ML projects.
